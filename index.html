      <h2> Basic information about this <em> beautiful creature </em></h2>
    <p> Cocker spaniels are known for being <strong> gentle, easy-going and affectionate yet lively.</strong> They are generally considered good with children. They tend to be non-aggressive toward other animals and people, but that also means they are not particularly good watchdogs.The coat comes in enough colors and patterns to please any taste. The well-balanced body is sturdy and solid, and these quick, durable gundogs move with a smooth, easy gait.They are <strong> easily trained as companions and athletes.</strong> They are big enough to be sporty, but compact enough to be portable.
