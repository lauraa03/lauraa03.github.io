They tend to be non-aggressive toward other animals and people, but that also means they are not particularly good watchdogs.The coat comes in enough colors and patterns to please any taste. The well-balanced body is sturdy and solid, and these quick, durable gundogs move with a smooth, easy gait.They are <strong> easily trained as companions and athletes.</strong> They are big enough to be sporty, but compact enough to be portable.

      <h3> <em> History </em> of Cocker Spaniels </h4>
      <p> The cocker spaniel, often referred to as the American cocker spaniel, descends from the English cocker spaniel. <strong>The name "cocker" comes from the woodcock </strong>, a game bird that these dogs efficiently flushed out for hunters.
Cocker spaniels were introduced to the United States in the late 1800s and were still considered the same breed as the English cocker spaniel. American fanciers selected for smaller size, greater coat, and a rounder head; today, the cocker spaniel and the English cocker spaniel are considered separate breeds. The cocker spaniel is smaller than its English counterpart and is the smallest of sporting dogs.
Although still considered a proficient hunter and sporting breed, cocker spaniels are more often family pets. Their popularity soared after World War II. <strong>In 1984, cocker spaniels were the number one breed registered with the American Kennel Club.</strong>

      <h2> <em> Living </em> with Cocker Spaniel</h2>
      <p> Cocker spaniels enjoy attention, so this is a <strong>breed for people who like to lavish affection on their pets.</strong>
They are average shedders. They do have an elaborate coat, which requires grooming at least a couple of hours weekly to keep it in good shape. Some professional trimming from time to time is needed. Avoid exercising cocker spaniels in places with burrs and thickets that can tangle the coat.
Cocker spaniels can adapt to living just about anywhere, as long as they are given <strong>daily walks on a leash or are allowed to have play sessions </strong>in a fenced yard. Remember, they are primarily an <strong>active sporting breed.</strong>
